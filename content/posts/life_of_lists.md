summary: "It's in here somewhere"

Open multiple editors for addresses in a list, move back and forth
Move to editor or shell for project/branch/machine/file/symbol
Opening a new pane in the hub keeps the outpost context of the pane it was openend from e.g. if I open a pane while in a directory in a Docker container through an SSH session, the new pane starts in that directory

Search for definitions and usages and files in the current project, both source an docs.
Compilation failures, test failures, stack traces, search results, diff chunks are lists of addresses.
They should be navigable and annotatable
