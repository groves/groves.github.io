I'm going to be sincere in this post. There may be more uncomfortable things I could do, but I haven't felt them yet.

When pressed for a worldview, my wife and I have described ourselves as "cheerful nihilists" for most of our adult lives. That phrase wraps a [Vantablack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantablack) core of the meaningless of our culture's arc in a pastel explosion of the joy, love, and beauty you can find in individual existence. As a way for two people of similar temperament to navigate the world together, it's worked quite well. It's allowed us to decide what parts of our culture to follow and what parts to ignore while prioritizing being decent to other beings. The moment-by-moment of existence was messier, but it's directionally correct.

I started meditating several years ago. I can't say precisely why. I worked at [a company adding meditation to its products](https://www.fitbit.com/) and it was in the air at the time. [The app I started with](https://www.headspace.com/) got me settled into a daily 10 minute practice. It helped with not getting too worked up about the difficulties of the Vantablack portion of my life, but it didn't shift my worldview at all.

I switched to [a new app](https://www.wakingup.com/) a few years into that as the first was starting to feel repetitive. While the new app's meditations still didn't change how I viewed the world, it got me to start thinking there might be a shift in worldview found deeper in these meditation practices.
